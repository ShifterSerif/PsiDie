Testing to see the validity of the Psionic Dice in TTRPGs

Psionic dice are a modulating system of rolling a of a specific size, and if you roll too high or low on the dice, the size of the die changes until eventually you are left with a die size of 0 and stay there (unless another ability resets it or modifies it).

This idea came from WoTC's "Psionic Options Revisited" Unearthed Arcana (<https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/UA2020_PsionicOptions.pdf>)
