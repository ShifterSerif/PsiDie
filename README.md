# PsiDie

Testing to see the validity of the Psionic Dice in TTRPGs

Psionic dice are a modulating system of rolling a of a specific size, and if you roll too high or low on the dice, the size of the die changes until eventually you are left with a die size of 0 and stay there (unless another ability resets it or modifies it).

Currently experimenting on how to make this work in Pathfinder 2e as an option for psychics.

This idea came from WoTC's "Psionic Options Revisited" Unearthed Arcana (<https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/UA2020_PsionicOptions.pdf>)
